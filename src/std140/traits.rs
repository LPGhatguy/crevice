/**
Trait implemented for all types that can be turned into `std140` values.

This trait can often be `#[derive]`'d instead of manually implementing it. Any
struct which contains only fields that also implement `AsStd140` can derive
`AsStd140`.

Types from the mint crate implement `AsStd140`, making them convenient for use
in uniform types. Most Rust geometry crates, like cgmath, nalgebra, and
ultraviolet support mint.

## Example

```glsl
uniform CAMERA {
    mat4 view;
    mat4 projection;
} camera;
```

```
use cgmath::prelude::*;
use cgmath::{Matrix4, Deg, perspective};
use crevice::std140::{AsStd140, Std140};

#[derive(AsStd140)]
struct CameraUniform {
    view: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32>,
    projection: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32>,
}

let camera = CameraUniform {
    view: Matrix4::identity().into(),
    projection: perspective(Deg(60.0), 16.0/9.0, 0.01, 100.0).into(),
};

# fn write_to_gpu_buffer(bytes: &[u8]) {}
let camera_std140 = camera.as_std140();
write_to_gpu_buffer(camera_std140.as_bytes());
```
