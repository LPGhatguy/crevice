/**
Trait implemented for all types that can be turned into `std430` values.

This trait can often be `#[derive]`'d instead of manually implementing it. Any
struct which contains only fields that also implement `AsStd430` can derive
`AsStd430`.

Types from the mint crate implement `AsStd430`, making them convenient for use
in uniform types. Most Rust geometry crates, like cgmath, nalgebra, and
ultraviolet support mint.

## Example

```glsl
uniform CAMERA {
    mat4 view;
    mat4 projection;
} camera;
```

```no_run
use crevice::std430::{AsStd430, Std430};

#[derive(AsStd430)]
struct CameraUniform {
    view: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32>,
    projection: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32>,
}

let view: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32> = todo!("your math code here");
let projection: mint::ColumnMatrix4<f32> = todo!("your math code here");

let camera = CameraUniform {
    view,
    projection,
};

# fn write_to_gpu_buffer(bytes: &[u8]) {}
let camera_std430 = camera.as_std430();
write_to_gpu_buffer(camera_std430.as_bytes());
```
